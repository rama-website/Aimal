    <p>One of the easiest things to let slip during these hectic months are follow-up appointments for our pets
     issues that we perceive as “little things that can wait”, such as vaccines and annual wellness exams. 
     When was the last time you checked your pet’s medical records to see when he or she is due for that important screening or set of core vaccines? 
     January is a great time to start the New Year off on the right wellness path for your pet, and those wellness exams are essential in preventative care. 
    If your pet is overdue, 
    now is a good time to reach out to your regular Veterinarian to book a January appointment</p>
